# AGENTS.md

This project is a compiler for my own programming language called "Telia".
It is written in Go and it uses LLVM as the back-end for the compiler.

## Rules for working on this project

- For better understanding, read the [documentation files](./docs).
- Use subagents liberally to keep main context window clean
- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents
- Don't go further without asking for permission
